Abstract

   The glitch file format is a lightweight, text-based, language-
   independent program interchange format. It is used to specify
   programs to be executed on a stack machine that generates a
   bitstream. The output is commonly interpreted as audio data.


1.  Introduction

   The glitch file format is a text format for the serialization of
   programs generating bitstreams. It is derived from the implementation
   of the iOS application Glitch Machine [GLITCHMACHINE].

   Programs noted in the glitch file format (glitches) contain
   instructions for a stack machine and integer constants. Its design
   goals were for it to be minimal, portable and textual.

   The glitch file format was intended to be usable in microblogging
   applications. Those commonly limit textual messages to 140 characters
   to force messages to be terse and discourage intelligent discourse
   [HTML].

1.1.  Conventions Used in This Document

   The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT",
   "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this
   document are to be interpreted as described in [RFC2119].

   The grammatical rules in this document are to be interpreted as
   described in [RFC4234].

2.   Glitch File Format Grammar

   A glitch consists of sequences of characters. In general, a glitch is
   written as follows:

   <title>!<instructions>

   Title names consist of a sequence of zero or more characters, with
   an upper limit of 16 characters. The lower case letters "a"--"z",
   digits and the character underscore ("_") are allowed.

   Instructions consist of lines separated by exclamation marks ("!").

   Lines consist of a sequence of one or more characters. The upper case
   letters "A"--"Z", lower case letters "a"--"z", numbers "0"--"9", the
   period (".") and the exclamation mark ("!") are allowed.

   Programs interpreting glitches SHOULD output a warning when
   encountering any character other than "A"--"Z", "a"--"z", "0"--"9",
   "_", ".", "!" or a single new line (LF) at the end of a file.
