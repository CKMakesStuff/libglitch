Abstract

   The glitch file format is a lightweight, text-based, language-
   independent program interchange format. It is used to specify
   programs to be executed on a stack machine that generates a
   bitstream. The output is commonly interpreted as audio data.


1.  Introduction

   The glitch file format is a text format for the serialization of
   programs generating bitstreams. It is derived from the implementation
   of the iOS application Glitch Machine [GLITCHMACHINE].

   Programs noted in the glitch file format can contain instructions for
   a stack machine and integer constants. The glitch file format design
   goals were for it to be minimal, portable and textual. It was
   intended to be usable in microblogging applications, which commonly
   limit textual messages to 140 characters or less.
