libglitch makes 8-bit sounds in the spirit of viznut's [“algorithmic symphonies”][1], using a small language not entirely unlike Forth. Included is a small programm reading formulas from the command line. GNU/Linux users may try “./glitter.py a8jak | aplay -f u8”.

libglitch is inspired by a [comment from madgarden][2], who kindly provided the [Opcodes][3] he uses in his iPhone application.
